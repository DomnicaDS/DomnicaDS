<h1>Hello there!ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h3>Welcome to my GitHub Profile!</h3>
<p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/domnica-seitan/">Domnica Seitan</a> and I'm a Data Science enthusiast. <br><br>
My hobbies include painting, photographing nature's beauty and solving puzzles.<br><br>
I have a diverse background experience that has helped me build a broad knowledge base about business and develop great skills in communication, teamwork and customer relations.<br><br>
I have decided to enter the Data Science field because it's such an interesting area of expertise combining technical and soft skills with so many applications. 
<br><br>

<summary><strong>What I love</strong></summary>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>I love understanding the methodology behind the so-called spam emails that target customers based on their search history, past purchases and what the recommendation system suggests based on your "neighbors". I found it really interesting while I was learning about this to see the real-life applications in my personal inbox from Amazon. </li> 
  <li>I love analyzing everything around me and with the right tools I can now dive deeper into this curiosity of mine and find helpful insights that can help others.</li>
  <li>I love to create and the data visualizations are great, because I get to combine them with narrative to inspire and drive positive change.</li>
  <li>I love sharing and talking with others and from years of experience with customers I've developed great communication skills that I apply now into data storytelling.</li>
  </ul>
  I could tell you all day more about what drives me and what I love, but for a bit of context, I'll share with you what I don't love in next section.

<summary><strong>What I do</strong></summary>
  <p><ul><li>Following the above section where I detail a few things that I love, let me tell you about what I don't love. My biggest pet peeve is when people throw their rubbish on the street, in the park, from their car on the side of the road or even on the highway. I chose to do something about it and started volunteering with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1773154196056159">Keep Hart Clean</a> and the community work is such a wonderful solution for helping our environment.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Another passion of mine is to connect with people and for this reason I joined the <a href="https://www.womenindata.org/">Women in Data</a> community to meet other females in STEM. I'm actively supporting the London Chapter to build the community further, networking and supporting women in the tech industry to increase diversity in data careers.</li>
  </ul></p>
