<p><a href="https://www.womenindata.org/">Women in Data</a> has had a great impact on my data journey, being able to connect with data professionals and learn from the community and supporting further other females in STEM. I'm actively volunteering as the Co-Lead for the London Chapter where we host monthly events with external speakers or networking with the mission of supporting women in the tech industry, increasing diversity in data careers and close the gender gap.
